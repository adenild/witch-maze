The little witch Morgana decided to make fun of an old witch who walked slowly and was always late.

As a curse, the powerful old witch sent Morgana into a very strange maze, where the walls do not change and time seems to repeat itself eternally.

Morgana enlisted your help to recover the magic items that appear and get enough magic power to break free from the maze.

As soon as you arrive, you hear the curse in the old witch's voice, which looks like an ancient scroll that falls apart when touched
- Morgana! As long as your heart, empathy and kindness are not aligned and consistent with your magical power, you will be confined in this maze!
